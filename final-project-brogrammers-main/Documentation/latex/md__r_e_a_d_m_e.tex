Learning management system that helps an {\bfseries{Admin}} to manage university, where the Admin can\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add / delete -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Student, Professor, courses and other admins as well
\item Search -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} through all Student, Professor, courses
\item Filter displayed data in Student, Professor, courses ~\newline

before start codind our programm we design different {\bfseries{UML DIAGRAMS}} to help visualizing work flow of the programm and the neccessary classes, so we have implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use Case Diagram
\item Sequence Diagram
\item Class Diagram
\item Activity Diagram here on of UMls diagram, Sequence Diagram that shows flow of the program 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Technology}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
we implement this project using {\bfseries{c++}} programming language and {\bfseries{QT framework}} to design responisve UI ~\newline
 the reason we choose this language is its speed compilation process comparing to other programming languages like python or java, as we need out porject to efficient when dealing with big data.~\newline
 imagin the Admin want to search through all students data which store data of every single student in the whole university, the process need to be fast. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Work Flow}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
Admin need to login firs, then the dashboard appears displaying following info\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Admin info
\item manage students option
\item manage proffesors option
\item manage courses option
\item manage admins option~\newline

{\bfseries{Amir hesham(\+TL)}} design a responive UI to make the program reliable and has the ability to work on different devices.~\newline
 {\bfseries{omar mohamed \& hesham tamer}} design UML diagrams to make coding stage piece of cake, code functions that check if enterd mail and password match any mail and passowrd of any existing admin.~\newline
 {\bfseries{omar mohamed \& mohamed alaa}} code student class, improving its functionality of add, remove, search for student.~\newline
 {\bfseries{Muhannad}} code admin class to make any admin able to add or remove other admins.~\newline
 {\bfseries{fady mohsed}} code professor class, improving its functionality of add, remove, search for pofessor as well as writing and publishing the code documentation (doxygen).~\newline
